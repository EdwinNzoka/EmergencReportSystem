      Men hurriedly pushed wheelbarrows full of corn, eggs and drinking water. Women carried buckets of supplies on their heads.

    <h3>Senior Hamas official says he ‘cannot reassure anyone’ that hostages in Gaza are safe</h3>
    <p>A senior Hamas official told CNN that he cannot provide any assurances about the wellbeing of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, but rejected a United Nations special representative’s finding that there is “clear and convincing information” that some of them have been sexually abused.<br>
      “I cannot now reassure you, anyone, because all these war prisoners are facing the same bombardment and starvation our people (are) facing on the ground,” said Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, even as he “absolutely” denied the allegations of sexual abuse.<br>
      In a wide-ranging and sometimes contentious Zoom interview from his office in Istanbul, Turkey, Naim spoke to CNN on Wednesday about the state of ceasefire negotiations with Israel, the fate of 130 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas, and Hamas’ share of responsibility for the widespread devastation unleashed by the Israeli military in Gaza in response to the October 7 terrorist attacks that killed more than 1,200 people.

    <h3>5 Conditions Associated with Uncontrollable Laughing or Crying</h3>
    <p>There are many conditions associated with pseudobulbar affect.<br>However, it is often associated with neurological disorders and brain injuries.<br>
      Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a neurological condition characterized by episodes of involuntary and uncontrollable laughing or crying unrelated to your emotions.<br>
      People with PBA don’t have control over how intensely or how long they laugh or cry. Often, you won’t feel the same relief from laughter or crying that you would when you voluntarily exercise those behaviors.
